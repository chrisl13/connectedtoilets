#Connected Toilets

simple web page to query the British Gas Safe and Secure API to determine the status of 5 contact sensors placed on toilet cubicle doors to determine the "occupancy state" of the toilet.

Each contact sensor has been named using the Safe and Secure system. A list of all sensors and their state is retreived from the system and placed into an map using sensor name as the key.

The HTML generated is coded to look for specific sensor names - however a more dynamic dashboard could be generated simply by using all entries in the map.
